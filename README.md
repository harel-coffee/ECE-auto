In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), several counterfactual explainers have been proposed, each focusing on some desirable
properties of counterfactual instances: minimality, actionability, stability, diversity, plausibility, discriminative power. We propose an ensemble
of counterfactual explainers that boosts weak explainers, which provide only a subset of such properties, to a powerful method covering all of
them. The ensemble runs weak explainers on a sample of instances and of features, and it combines their results by exploiting a diversity-driven
selection function. The method is model-agnostic and, through a wrapping approach based on autoencoders, it is also data-agnostic
